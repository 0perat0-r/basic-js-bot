Take the index.js and the .env files. The package.json is just there so you can see my dependencies, once you have those files in a folder open your console and type
npm init -y, then npm install discord.js, then npm install dotenv Go to your .env file and insert your token. Note: You must have Node.js installed. After all that open 
the console and type node . This will start your bot then in a server that the bot is in type ping this will have the bot reply with Pong!. This is the most basic discord.js 
bot structure, hope it helped.
